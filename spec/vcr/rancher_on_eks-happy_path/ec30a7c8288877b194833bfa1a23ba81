NAME: rancher-stable
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Feb 17 12:45:12 2023
NAMESPACE: cattle-system
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Rancher Server has been installed.

NOTE: Rancher may take several minutes to fully initialize. Please standby while Certificates are being issued, Containers are started and the Ingress rule comes up.

Check out our docs at https://rancher.com/docs/

If you provided your own bootstrap password during installation, browse to https://rancher-setup-test.aws.bear454.com to get started.

If this is the first time you installed Rancher, get started by running this command and clicking the URL it generates:

```
echo https://rancher-setup-test.aws.bear454.com/dashboard/?setup=$(kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template='{{.data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode}}')
```

To get just the bootstrap password on its own, run:

```
kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template='{{.data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode}}{{ "\n" }}'
```


Happy Containering!
